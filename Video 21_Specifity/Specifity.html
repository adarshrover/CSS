    <!--CSS stands for cascade stylesheets.Here cascade is the algorithm for solving conflicts where multiple css rules apply to an HTML element   
    Rules---
    1.Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
    2.Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
    3.Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS
    4.Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type
   
    Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector

    Calculation of specifity---
